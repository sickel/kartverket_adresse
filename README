QGIS plugin to read coordinates from the Norwegian mapping authority's address-api, https://ws.geonorge.no/adresser/v1/#/default/get_sok

version 0.2

The data will be stored in a memory layer that will vanish when QGIS is exited.

The text entered is used for the søk attribute, i.e. it is a freetext search on all available addresses. For example
a search on Høyenhallveien will give two sets of addresses, in Oslo and Drøbak, Høyenhallv* will also show results from Høyenhallvegen in Gjøvik.
A search on Storgata will give a lot of Storgata addresses around Norway, Storgata Frogn will only give the ones in Frogn.

For documentation of the API, see https://ws.geonorge.no/adresser/v1/



TODO: 
* Only a few of the attributes are stored, add in all attributes
* Use more of the search possibilities in the API
* Store data in an existing map layer
* Rewrite as a processing plugin
